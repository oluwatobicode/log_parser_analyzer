# Log Parser and Analyzer

This project is a Python-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) log parser and analyzer designed to identify and flag suspicious activity from IDS logs (gotten from a public github) like Suricata. It parses logs from a JSON file, compares each entry against a set of custom detection rules (based on fields like severity, category, and signature), and flags matching logs as critical.The flagged logs are then passed to an analyzer for further insightâ€”like detecting recurring patterns or high-risk behavior. For real-time alerting, the system integrates a Telegram bot that sends notifications when specific threats or patterns are detected.Built for learning and practical application in SOC (Security Operations Center) environments, the project promotes hands-on experience in log analysis, threat detection, and basic automation for incident response.
