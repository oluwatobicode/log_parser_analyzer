# kindly ignore my thought process ðŸ˜‚

# encounterd an issue of getting processed:44 flags,flagged:93
# this was because a log matched multiple rules and was being pushed more
#  than once into my flagged_logs = [] array
#  currently when we loop through all our ids logs
#  for each log we get loop with all our rules 
#  if the logs matches more than one rule, it is added to 
#  the flagged_logs multiple times - one for each match


# HOW to FIX IT 
#  1. i checked the array for duplicate logs
#  2. if there is i appended the new match (level,description) to what rules it matches
#  3. if no i created a new log entry with matches initalized


# basically i changed the output of the log to that so instaed of multiple 
# logs with different matches one match per log is done
